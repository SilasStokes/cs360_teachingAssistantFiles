Summary of files:

- gitall : A bash script that clones all the repo's shared with you, used for grading. I chose to clone them as I ran into some issues trying to git pull all their code. Improvements would be automating the time at which the script runs.
- mtx_script.sh : a bash script that gets a file off of KC's website and then runs it. Made as an example for students to look at when they need to get a binary file off of KC's website. This could definitely be given out earlier in the semester, like for lab1. 
- bash_snippets : Assorted one liners that came in handy throughout the semester.
